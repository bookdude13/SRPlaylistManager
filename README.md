A Synth Riders mod for better in-game management of playlists.

## Requirements
- PCVR (Steam) version of Synth Riders. No modding support for standalone Oculus yet :/ I've mainly tested on Oculus Quest 2 through Oculus Link.

## Installing
1. Prepare Synth Riders for modding by following the [MelonLoader](https://melonwiki.xyz/#/README) wiki guide
2. Download the newest version of SRPlaylistManager from the Releases section. Your web browser may warn you about the .zip file because it contains a .dll - this is normal, and is how mods are built. Save the zip file.
3. Extract the contents of the .zip file to  `<path-to-synth-riders>\Mods` (create a new directory if it doesn't exist). On Windows, this will be at `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\SynthRiders\Mods`
4. Run Synth Riders and enjoy!

## Development
Feel free to extend this as you want. Open issues for bugs and feature requests, and open PRs if you implement some of those yourself. I will try to respond in a timely manner :)

## Issues
If issues arise, add an Issue to this repository or ping me on Discord.
